# Odinbook Frontend, final project for The Odin Project

This is the frontend repository which has been deployed on [netlify](https://radiant-piroshki-78e42e.netlify.app).
You can login with a Facebook account (which will be used to create an account for you), or if you want to browse the website, you can use a Guest Account. Contact me and I will provide you a password. 

## Frontend frameworks

I used React and Tailwind to develop the frontend, styled minimaly at the time.

## Backend 

For the backend I used Express and MongoDB. You can find the repository on [github](https://github.com/paposeco/odinbookbackend) too.
